			<h1>About Himanshu Bahuguna</h1>
			<p>I spent my childhood in a small town called Karanprayag, situated in the hill state Uttarakhand(India). I went to War Memorial Governtment Inter College for my schooling in my home town. I completed my B.E. in Computer Science from Govind Ballabh Pant Engineering College Pauri Garhwal. I also enrolled in the PGDST course in CDAC Bangalore for a brief period of time after my B.E.. I received a job offer from Ness Technologies in Bangalore while still pursuing PGDST in CDAC. I was appointed as a software engineer where I worked for IBM as a client. When in Ness Technologies, I received star of the quarter award for my work for IBM</p>
			<p>After my stint in Ness Technologies, I joined a database automation startup in New Yrok city, which was later acquired by BMC Software. I got to learn a lot about database automation, system administration and test automation frameworks in perl. When in BMC Software, I developed a VMware node inventory management system which was very helpful for our team to figure out status of VMs</p>
			<p>I joined about.com after working for BMC Software for more than 6 years. It was a new experience from project management point of view since everything was agile. I was new to the world of standups, grooming and planning sessions but got used to it. As the releases were done at such a fast pace, we needed to develop automation frameworks to keep pace with development. I worked on developing a WebDriver and Java 8 based automation framework called Venus. Later about.com decided to split itself into smaller websites which required us to create automation suites based on Venus.</p>
			<p>I also like to keep pace with new trends in technology while working on my day job, so I'm an avid fan on Udacity and other MOOCs. I started with some small courses on web development and python on Udacity. Later I thought of trying my hands on Udacity's Android Development Nanodegree. I got to work on many interesting Andorid projects and as part of my capstone project, I happened to publish an android app to Play Store. After completing Android Development Nanodegree I got enrolled in to Udacity's Artificial Intelligence Nanodegree Program. I learnt a lot about machine learning and neural networks such as CNNs and RNNs. I graduated with concentration in Voice User Interfaces, where I developed an Alexa skill and a Speech Recognizer using Deep Neural Networks.</p>
			<p>Apart from tech and programming, my hobbies include reading, hiking and travelling. When I was in college I was part of college Cricket team.I also like to play indoor games such as Carrom and Table Tennis.</p>
